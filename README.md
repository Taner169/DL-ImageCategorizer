# Deep Learning for Image Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`DeepLearning_ImageClassify.ipynb`) that focuses on image classification using CNN architectures. We explore building a custom model from scratch and also leverage the VGG16 architecture for transfer learning.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Multiclass Image Dataset (Airplane, Car, Ship)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abtabm/multiclassimagedatasetairplanecar)
- **Author**: Taner
- **Directory**: `image_Classification_CNN`

## Models

1. **Custom Model**: Designed from scratch, achieving a validation accuracy of approximately 91.07%.

2. **VGG16-based Model**: Utilizing transfer learning with VGG16 as the base model, this model achieved a validation accuracy of approximately 98.28%.

## Running the Notebook

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abtabm/multiclassimagedatasetairplanecar) and place it in the `image_Classification_CNN` directory.
3. Open `DeepLearning_ImageClassify.ipynb` and execute the cells to reproduce the results.
